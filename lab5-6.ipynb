    "# Overall Conclusion\n",
    "## Health Priority and Academic Performance:\n",
    "There is no significant correlation between prioritizing health and academic success among college students. Both the point-biserial correlation and the chi-squared test indicated no statistically significant relationship between health prioritization and GPA. The average GPAs for students who prioritize health and those who do not are very close.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imposter Syndrome and Mental Wellbeing:\n",
    "While there is a moderate negative correlation between experiencing imposter syndrome and mental wellbeing, there is no significant association between mean imposter syndrome and academic performance. The chi-squared test found no statistically significant relationship between imposter syndrome and GPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Financial Stress and Academic Performance:\n",
    "There is no significant linear relationship between financial stress and academic performance, as indicated by both Pearson and Spearman correlation tests. However, the Spearman test suggests a potential trend that is just short of statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Overall, the current analysis does not strongly support the hypotheses proposed. While some weak correlations were observed, they were not statistically significant. It may have been that other factors beyond those examined in this study may have had a more substantial influence on academic performance among college students. Further research with a larger sample size and consideration of additional variables may have provided deeper insights for the relationship between student health and academic success."
