    "- The correlation coefficient of 0.0165 suggests a very weak positive correlation between Health Priority and GPA.\n",
    "- The p-value for the correlation is 0.8801, which is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, indicating that the correlation is not statistically significant.\n",
